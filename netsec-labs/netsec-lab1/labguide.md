## Network isolation (45 minutes)

- Configure VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 on SW1 and SW2
- Create a VRF called blue on SW2
- SW2 should be the routing point, configure a gateway on SW2 (SVI), it should be attached to VRF blue
  - VLAN 10 gw: 192.168.11.254 255.255.252.0
  - VLAN 20 gw: 192.168.12.30 255.255.255.224
- Configure a routed port towards the firewall, using .1q subinterface (10.200.0.0/31)
- Configure the second port as tagged/trunk mode with VLAN 30 extend over it
- Extend VLAN 30 down to SW3
- Configure host ports (access mode): PC1 should be in VLAN 10, PC2 in VLAN 20 and PC3 in VLAN 30
- Configure host to have a route for 10.1.1.1/32 pointing to their gateways
- Configure a VRF called red on SW2, with a loopback interface inside (ip: 10.1.1.1/32)
- Add a second .1q subinterface towards the firewall (10.200.0.2/31)
- Create default routes in each VRF (red and blue) pointing to the firewall
- show vlans
- show mac addresses learned
- is PC1 able to ping PC2? or PC3?
- show arp resolutions on the gateway
- show routing tables
- scan the subnets using nmap
