# Network Security - Case study 1

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to use the knowledge acquired in the network security fundamentals module.
It will make you think about network security in a global manner and have you select technical solutions tailored to the specific requirements of this fictional case study

## Description

ABCD corp, a cutting-edge bio-technology company based in Paris, has rapidly expanded its operations, establishing itself as a prominent player in the European market. With two main datacenter sites in Paris and Orleans, the company has recently set its sights on the United States, aiming to enhance customer service by opening new datacenter and office sites in Tulsa.

ABCD corp operates three distinct business units: research and development (R&D), DNA services, and corporate services. Each business unit possesses sensitive data and applications that require strong security measures due of the nature of the data processed. But lately, two of these units, R&D and DNA services, require communication due to their interdependent workflows. This data exchanges between the two BUs need to be carefully controlled.

At their Paris headquarters, an office site houses 200 employees, all of whom are currently connected within a single VLAN. Some improvements are required in this area to harness campus network security with the most mandatory best practices. 

ABCD corp's datacenters host a critical 3-tier application that is public-facing, necessitating robust security measures. This application serves genetic test reports to the clients. Presently, a single firewall protects the application, but with the company's expansion, a more comprehensive and scalable security infrastructure is imperative.

In terms of network administration, ABCD corp is currently relying on local accounts on various devices. However, the company already has an existing Active Directory infrastructure that could be further leveraged (all network administrators are grouped in the same container). 

At the moment, the management network is dedicated but interconnected to the production network on all sites, this being a critical dependency for network administrators. A more secure and resilient solution is needed.

ABCD corp acknowledges the urgency of establishing a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture that caters to its global expansion plans. The company seeks a comprehensive solution that not only ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data but also facilitates seamless communication between business units, both within individual sites and across international borders. Representing the EFG consulting company, you are tasked to provide the new network design. You are encouraged to prepare some labs and demonstrations to support your recommendations, as you'll need to convince the existing network team and CTO.

Some diagrams provided by the network team are attached in this folder.

## Tasks

Below is the list of mandatory points to tackle in this exercise, but any other relevant suggestions are welcomed.
- Assess how the BUs are connected and suggest improvements in data flow, inside the BU environment it is not mandatory to keep datacenter firewalling, 
- The company recognizes the need to isolate the business units within the office site too, enhancing both security and overall design,
- The main application for DNA test results needs to be more secured from a network standpoint, please suggest any improvement,
- Regarding network administration, the management network requires reevaluation, it would be good to ensure better isolation and turn it into a real out-of-band network,
- Network devices security should be improved, please suggest how to harden network devices, 
- As for authentication, migrating to a centralized user management system is essential to enhance security and streamline user access across all sites and business units, we may have administrators in other sites at some point,
- It would also great to plan where we could connect circuits going to the AWS cloud as we plan to grow in the cloud

## Deliverables

A report should be produced listing all the recommendations and detailing technical feasibility / implementation of features.
